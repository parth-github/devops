 You can then use knife node to add the install apache2 or nginx to the run list (or)
use knife bootstrap via ssh as below:
knife bootstrap --run-list "role[webappserver]" --sudo hostname

 With second option, you do have to create a role call webappserver that includes the
install of Apache2/NGINX in the run list

 In similar vein, create roles dev and production and update attached scripts to use a
default port of 80 with a force override of http_port to 90/99 based on role name
